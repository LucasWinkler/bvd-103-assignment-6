# bvd-103-assignment-1-template
This is a template repository for the first assignment in BVD 103 at McMaster Continuing Education.

For some reason I have to run this command below after docker-compose up:
docker-compose restart nginx

If I don't one of the services doesn't always start. Not entirely sure why.

Also keep in mind unfiltered books are cached so when you add/edit/delete a book it will not show up unless you search/filter for one for 30 seconds
